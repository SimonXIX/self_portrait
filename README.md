# self_portrait
Program to create artistic self-portraits using a simple HTML form and ASCII art

This program generates 'self-portraits' based on the parameters a user enters into a simple HTML form. The PHP script uses their input to retrieve a particular 'image' expressed in ASCII art. In production, this used ASCII art generated by http://picascii.com/ using photos found on Flickr.

This program was created as an artistic project for a friend's birthday party. The piece was displayed in a gallery running on a small tablet.
